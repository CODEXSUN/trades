# Multi-Repository Application Structure

## Rule

TRADES is developed as sibling repositories and composed as one Platform runtime. Repository
boundaries are ownership boundaries, not folders that may be crossed for convenience.

## Executable Composition

```text
trades/
  src/platform/api/      # executable API, auth, tenant context, Platform modules, DB composition
  src/platform/web/      # executable React shell, desks, routing, navigation composition
  tools/                 # stack, database, boundary, version, and release tooling
```

Platform imports only published package surfaces from sibling repositories. It may register routes,
compose menus, and order public migrations/seeds. It must not duplicate sibling business logic.

## Business Repository Structure

A full business repository uses:

```text
<app>/
  api/
    src/
      index.ts
      app.ts
      database/          # connection and lifecycle ordering only
      modules/
        <module>/
  web/
    src/
      index.ts
      modules/
        <module>/
      shared/            # cross-module code within this app only
```

The current full business repository installed in Trades is `core`.

### Backend leaf

A synchronous CRUD leaf owns:

```text
<module>.migration.ts
<module>.module.ts
<module>.repository.ts
<module>.routes.ts
<module>.seed.ts
<module>.service.ts
<module>.types.ts
index.ts
```

Add event, worker, or sync roles only when executable behavior exists.

### Frontend leaf

A CRUD frontend leaf owns:

```text
<module>.workspace.tsx
<module>.list.tsx
<module>.form.tsx
<module>.services.ts
<module>.hooks.ts
<module>.schema.ts
<module>.types.ts
index.ts
```

Settings, print, show, or test files are added only for real owned behavior.

## Infrastructure Repositories

- `framework/src`: stable backend contracts and runtime primitives; no business tables or seeds.
- `ui/src`: reusable presentation primitives; no business fields, routes, schemas, or workflows.

Billing, Mail, Ecommerce, and Sites are not part of the current Trades composition. If added in
the future, they must adopt the business repository structure and register through public package
contracts without moving their behavior into Platform.

## Standalone Devkit

`devkit` is a separate executable developer application. It is not a Platform package, migration
participant, or seed participant. Platform release commands must not mutate Devkit.

## Cross-Repository Rules

- Imports use declared package exports.
- No `../<sibling>/src/...` imports.
- No sibling repository/service/migration/seed/form/hook private imports.
- Cross-repository writes require an approved application service or event.
- A child owns its minimal lookup type and calls a fixed public lookup contract.
- The record owner owns reverse relation responses and delete blockers.
- Platform is the only composition root for the customer runtime.

## Database And Environment Rules

The repository that owns a table owns its migration and seed. Composition order must mirror foreign
key and lookup dependencies. Libraries do not own Platform `.env` files; the executable runtime
owns and validates configuration.

## Build And Release

Each repository installs, checks, builds, versions, commits, and pushes independently. The
`trades` lockfile records the exact local composition baseline. A composed release must verify
the versions currently resolved by that lockfile.
